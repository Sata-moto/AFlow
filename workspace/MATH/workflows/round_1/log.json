        "question": "Steve has three quarters, three nickels and three pennies. If Steve selects three coins at random and without replacement, what is the probability that the total value is exactly 35 cents? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "right_answer": "There are a total of ${9 \\choose 3} = \\frac{9\\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{3 \\cdot 2} = 84$ sets of 3 coins in total. The only way to get 35 cents is to have a quarter and two nickels, which can be done in ${3 \\choose 1} \\cdot {3 \\choose 2} = 9$ ways. So, the probability is $\\frac{9}{84} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{28}}$.",
        "model_output": "We are given:\n\n- **Three quarters** (25¢ each)\n- **Three nickels** (5¢ each)\n- **Three pennies** (1¢ each)\n\nSteve randomly selects **three coins**, **without replacement**, and we want to find the **probability** that their **total value is exactly 35 cents**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Total number of possible combinations\n\nThere are a total of $9$ coins (3 quarters + 3 nickels + 3 pennies), and we choose 3 of them. The total number of ways to do this is:\n\n$$\n\\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 84\n$$\n\nSo there are **84 total possible selections** of 3 coins from the group of 9.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Find all combinations of 3 coins whose total value is **exactly 35 cents**\n\nLet’s list out which combinations can possibly sum to 35 cents.\n\nWe'll consider all possible combinations of quarters (Q), nickels (N), and pennies (P) such that:\n- Number of coins = 3\n- Total value = 35 cents\n\nTry different numbers of quarters in the selection:\n\n### Case 1: One quarter (25¢)\nThen remaining two coins must add up to **10 cents**.\nPossible options for 10 cents using nickels and pennies:\n- Two nickels → 10¢ ✅\n- One nickel and five pennies ❌ (we only have 3 coins total, so not enough space for 6 coins)\n- Ten pennies ❌ (only 3 allowed)\n\n✅ So one valid combination here:\n- 1 quarter, 2 nickels\n\nCheck if we have enough coins:\n- We have 3 quarters, so choosing 1 is okay\n- We have 3 nickels; choosing 2 is okay\n\n→ This is **valid**\n\nNow check how many such combinations exist.\n\nNumber of ways to pick:\n- 1 quarter from 3: $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$\n- 2 nickels from 3: $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$\n\nTotal favorable outcomes for this case:\n\n$$\n3 \\times 3 = 9\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Case 2: Two quarters (50¢",
