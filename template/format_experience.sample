These are some conclusions drawn from experience:

-Absolutely prohibit Add ScEnsemble operator to generate multiple solutions and verify the final answer through consistency checking

Note: Take into account past failures and avoid repeating the same mistakes, as these failures indicate that these approaches are ineffective. You must fundamentally change your way of thinking, rather than simply using more advanced Python syntax like for, if, else, etc., or modifying the prompt.
